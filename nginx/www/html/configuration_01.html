    <p>Iteration 1.</p>
    <p>The file <span style="font-family: monospace;">/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</span>:</p>
    <pre>This is some miscellaneous code that I put together<br>It doesn't do anything<br>It's just random text that looks like code.</pre>
    <p>This is the file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default&nbsp; but this is poor
      example because it's too complicated.</p>

# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.
# https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/
# https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/
# https://wiki.debian.org/Nginx/DirectoryStructure
#
# In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and
# leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be
# updated by the nginx packaging team.
#
# This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other
# applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress. These applications will be made
# available underneath a path with that package name, such as /drupal8.
#
# Please see /usr/share/doc/nginx-doc/examples/ for more detailed examples.
