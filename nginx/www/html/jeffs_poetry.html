    <h1>Jeff's page of really bad poetry.</h1>
    <p>Ever wonder why I went into computers?  It's because if I had to make my
      living as a poet, I'd starve.</p>
    <p>There once was a physicist bright,<br />
      Whose theories were quite a fright.<br />
         His math was all wrong,<br />
         His experiments gone long,<br />
      In chaos, his equations took flight.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>There was a coder with flair,<br />
      Whose coding was beyond compare.<br />
         But one fateful day, <br />
         His computer gave way,<br />
      And now he's stuck pulling out hair!</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>There was a network engineer so bold,<br />
      Whose cables were always in a stranglehold.<br />
         He'd patch and he'd ping, <br />
         But his network would sting,<br />
      Leaving users in a digital cold.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>There once was a DB admin so grand,<br />
      Whose database skills were in high demand.<br />
         But alas, with a click,<br />
         They deleted too quick,<br />
      Now their career is sinking in sand.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>There was a salesperson, quite sly,<br />
      Whose pitches would make angels cry.<br />
         With promises tall,<br />
         And charm, most of all,<br />
      Their ethics were always awry.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>There once was an IT manager so stern,<br />
      Whose servers would crash and burn.<br />
        With a wave of his hand,<br />
        He'd demand a new plan,<br />
      But alas, he could never learn!</p>
    <p><br />

    <p>Thank you, ChatGPT, for authoring the above much faster than I could have
      done.</p>
