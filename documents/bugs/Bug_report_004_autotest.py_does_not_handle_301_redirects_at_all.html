    <h1>Bug report #4: autester.py does not handle 301 redirects at all</h1>
    <h2>Priority: Low</h2>

    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p>When the autotester.py program hits a URL that returns a 301 redirect,
      the autotester.py ignores the redirect and looks for the string in the
      redirect message.&nbsp; Of course, it's not there, so it reports it as a
      failure.&nbsp; I think this is a false negative.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>I am using the httpx package which supports redirection.&nbsp; Just
      figure out how it works and implement it.</p>
    <p>In the interim, there is a work around.&nbsp; Have the
      test_production.tsv detect the string "301".&nbsp; That will allow it to
      pass the test.&nbsp; Then on the next line have the target of the
      redirect.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This is an easy fix, I think</p>
