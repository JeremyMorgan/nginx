Welcome to the git repository for the Kodekloud Nginx class.

All of the information developed by Jeff Silverman for the nginx class is kept in this repository.

As a broad generalization, this git repo is pretty vanilla with the exception of kodekloud/www.
kodekloud/www contains content that a web server could serve.  The web server should not have any
other information from this repository in it, that's just a recipe for confusion.
